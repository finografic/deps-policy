# @finografic/deps-policy — Manual

📅 Apr 26, 2026

Single authoritative reference for the `@finografic/deps-policy` package: what it is, how it's structured, how to maintain it, and how to release it.

---

## Overview

`@finografic/deps-policy` is the single source of truth for dependency versions across the `@finografic` ecosystem. Rather than each project independently managing which version of TypeScript, ESLint, or Vitest to install, all version decisions live here.

Consumers (`genx`, scaffolded projects) reference this package to:

- Know which version of each tool to install when creating a new project
- Align existing projects to the canonical versions during a `genx deps` update pass

The package exports plain TypeScript objects — no runtime logic, no network calls. It is a data package.

---

## Package structure

```
src/
  types.ts              # DependencyGroup, DependencyPolicy, PackageType, ToolchainPolicy
  index.ts              # exports: policy, toolchain, resolvePolicy()
  policy/
    index.ts            # re-exports base, cli, library, config, toolchain
    base.deps.ts        # devDeps shared by every @finografic package
    cli.deps.ts         # additional deps for genx:type:cli packages
    library.deps.ts     # additional deps for genx:type:library packages
    config.deps.ts      # additional deps for genx:type:config packages
    toolchain.ts        # canonical node and pnpm versions

src/deps-cli/           # built and published — CLI bin + programmatic API
  cli.ts                # bin entry — command registry, root --help / --version
  cli.help.ts           # root HelpConfig
  collect-deps.ts       # parse policy *.deps.ts sources → DepEntry[]
  resolve-latest.ts     # npm registry + GitHub Packages version fetch
  commands/
    index.ts            # programmatic API — re-exports runAudit, runOutdated, runUpdate
    audit/              # audit command
    outdated/           # outdated command
    update/             # update command
  output/               # terminal renderers (uses @finografic/cli-kit/tui for tables)
  types/                # DepEntry, DepEntryWithLatest, audit types
  utils/                # path + OSV helpers
```

Shared CLI primitives (`renderHelp`, `renderCommandHelp`, TUI layout helpers, `multiselectLineBreak`, `runPnpmInstall`) are imported from **`@finografic/cli-kit`**.

### Published entry points

| Export         | Dist file               | Purpose                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `.`            | `dist/index.mjs`        | Policy data — `policy`, `toolchain`, `resolvePolicy` |
| `./cli`        | `dist/cli.mjs`          | Programmatic runners — `runUpdate`, etc.             |
| `./policy`     | `dist/policy/index.mjs` | Re-exports policy groups directly                    |
| `./deps.types` | `dist/deps.types.mjs`   | Shared TypeScript types only                         |
| `bin: policy`  | `dist/bin/policy.mjs`   | Terminal CLI — `policy <command>`                    |

### Policy types

```ts
interface DependencyGroup {
  dependencies?: Record<string, string>;
  devDependencies?: Record<string, string>;
  peerDependencies?: Record<string, string>;
}

type PackageType = "cli" | "library" | "config";

interface ToolchainPolicy {
  node: string;
  pnpm: string;
}
```

---

## Policy object

The exported `policy` object gives direct access to every group:

```ts
import { policy, resolvePolicy } from "@finografic/deps-policy";

policy.base.devDependencies["typescript"]; // '^5.9.3'
policy.base.devDependencies["eslint"]; // '9.39.2'
policy.cli.dependencies["picocolors"]; // '^1.1.1'
```

`resolvePolicy(type)` merges `base` with the type-specific group into a single effective `DependencyGroup`:

```ts
const effective = resolvePolicy("cli");
// {
//   dependencies:    { picocolors: '^1.1.1' },
//   devDependencies: { typescript: '^5.9.3', vitest: '^4.0.18', ... }
// }
```

### Package types

| Type      | File                     | Used for                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `base`    | `policy/base.deps.ts`    | devDeps on every `@finografic` package           |
| `cli`     | `policy/cli.deps.ts`     | additional deps for `genx:type:cli` packages     |
| `library` | `policy/library.deps.ts` | additional deps for `genx:type:library` packages |
| `config`  | `policy/config.deps.ts`  | additional deps for `genx:type:config` packages  |

### Groups within `base`

`base.deps.ts` organises its `devDependencies` into named `const` groups. The policy CLI (`src/deps-cli/`) uses these group names as section headers when printing tables.

| Group                  | Contents                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`                | `typescript`, `tsdown`, `@types/node`                                                 |
| `testing`              | `vitest`                                                                              |
| `lintingAndFormatting` | `oxlint`, `oxlint-tsgolint`, `@finografic/md-lint`, `@finografic/oxc-config`, `oxfmt` |
| `hooks`                | `husky`, `lint-staged`, `@commitlint/cli`, `@commitlint/config-conventional`          |
| `ecosystem`            | `@finografic/project-scripts`                                                         |

---

## Toolchain policy

The `toolchain` object stores the canonical node and pnpm versions for the ecosystem. These are not npm packages — they have distinct storage locations and update mechanisms.

```ts
import { toolchain } from "@finografic/deps-policy";

toolchain.node; // '24.3.0'
toolchain.pnpm; // '10.32.1'
```

Version strings are bare semver (no prefixes). Formatting is the consumer's responsibility.

### Where toolchain versions are written in a target project

| Value            | Target                          | Format            | Example        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| `toolchain.node` | `.nvmrc`                        | bare version      | `24.3.0`       |
| `toolchain.node` | `package.json` `engines.node`   | `>=` + version    | `>=24.3.0`     |
| `toolchain.pnpm` | `package.json` `packageManager` | `pnpm@` + version | `pnpm@10.32.1` |

### How genx updates toolchain versions

Toolchain updates are distinct from package dependency updates — no `pnpm add` is involved.

**Node version** — two file writes:

1. Write `toolchain.node` to `.nvmrc`
2. Set `engines.node` to `>={toolchain.node}` in `package.json`

**pnpm version** — one field write:

1. Set `packageManager` to `pnpm@{toolchain.pnpm}` in `package.json`

### Updating toolchain versions in the policy

Edit `src/policy/toolchain.ts` directly, then build and typecheck:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm typecheck
```

Commit: `deps: bump node to <version>` or `deps: bump pnpm to <version>`

---

## How genx consumes this package

`@finografic/genx` imports `policy` directly:

```ts
// src/config/dependencies.rules.ts
import { policy } from "@finografic/deps-policy";

const dev = policy.base.devDependencies ?? {};

export const dependencyRules: DependencyRule[] = [
  { name: "typescript", version: dev["typescript"], section: "devDependencies" },
  { name: "vitest", version: dev["vitest"], section: "devDependencies" },
  // ...
];
```

When genx runs `genx deps` (or `genx create`), it calls `pnpm add -D package@version` using the version strings from these rules — never `--latest`. The version is always explicit and sourced from this package.

After releasing a new `deps-policy` version, genx must be updated:

```bash
# in @finografic/genx
pnpm update @finografic/deps-policy
```

Then commit: `deps: update deps-policy to <version>`.

---

## Authoring the policy

### Adding a new package

1. Decide which file owns it:

   | Applies to   | File                         |
   | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
   | All packages | `src/policy/base.deps.ts`    |
   | CLI only     | `src/policy/cli.deps.ts`     |
   | Library only | `src/policy/library.deps.ts` |
   | Config only  | `src/policy/config.deps.ts`  |

2. In `base.deps.ts`, add to the appropriate `const` group block. If it doesn't fit an existing group, create a new one and spread it into the `DependencyGroup` export.

3. In `cli.deps.ts` / `library.deps.ts` / `config.deps.ts`, add directly to `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in the exported object.

4. Build and typecheck: `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck`

5. In `genx`, add a matching entry to `src/config/dependencies.rules.ts` referencing the policy value.

6. Commit: `deps: add <package> to policy`

### Updating a version manually

Edit the version string directly in the source file, then:

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm typecheck
```

Commit: `deps: bump <package> to <version>`

Then release (see [Release workflow](#release-workflow)).

### Prefix conventions

| Prefix | Meaning                        | Use for                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `^`    | Compatible range (most common) | Stable packages with reliable semver                    |
| `~`    | Patch-only range               | Packages with unstable minor releases                   |
| none   | Pinned exact version           | Packages where minor/patch has caused issues (`eslint`) |

---

## Policy updater CLI

The updater CLI lives under `src/deps-cli/`. It checks all policy deps against the npm registry and GitHub Packages, and patches version strings in place. It is built and published as part of the package.

### Setup

The CLI reads GitHub Packages auth from `.env`:

```bash
# .env  (gitignored)
NPM_TOKEN=<your GitHub PAT with read:packages scope>
```

This token is the same one used by `.npmrc` to install `@finografic/*` packages locally.

### Terminal usage

**In this repo** (via `tsx` dev scripts):

```bash
pnpm policy:outdated          # check — display only, no writes
pnpm policy:audit             # vulnerability check via OSV database
pnpm policy:update            # interactive update — patches source files
pnpm policy:update --include-pinned  # also include pinned packages in the update list
pnpm policy:update:release    # non-interactive update, build, commit, patch release
```

**Globally installed** (after `pnpm link --global` or `npm install -g @finografic/deps-policy`):

```bash
policy outdated
policy update
policy update --include-pinned
policy audit
policy --help
policy --version
```

### Programmatic usage

Import individual runners from the `./cli` entry point. Each runner accepts an `argv` string array matching the flags the CLI accepts:

```ts
import { runUpdate, runOutdated, runAudit } from "@finografic/deps-policy/cli";

// Run interactively (same prompts as the terminal command)
await runUpdate([]);

// Pass flags
await runUpdate(["--include-pinned"]);

// Show help for a command
await runUpdate(["--help"]);
```

This is how `genx` can invoke policy commands without shelling out. The runners are self-contained — they manage their own clack output and process lifecycle.

---

### `policy:outdated`

Fetches the latest published version for every dep in the policy and displays a grouped table. No files are written.

- Public packages → `https://registry.npmjs.org`
- `@finografic/*` packages → `https://npm.pkg.github.com` with `NPM_TOKEN`
- Packages unavailable from either registry are shown as `(private)` and skipped

Output is grouped by file → group, showing only groups that contain at least one outdated entry. Packages on the latest version are shown as dim `✓`.

---

### `policy:update`

Runs the same fetch as `policy:outdated`, then opens interactive prompts. Pinned packages (no prefix) are excluded from the list by default — pass `--include-pinned` to include them.

**Range-prefixed packages** (`^x.y.z`, `~x.y.z`):

A multi-select list of outdated range-prefixed packages is shown. Nothing is pre-selected by default — choose the rows you want, then submit.

**Pinned packages** (no prefix, e.g. `9.39.2`):

Each outdated pinned package is handled individually, with a default of "skip":

```
  eslint is pinned at 9.39.2 — latest is 10.2.0. Update?
  ○ No, keep at 9.39.2         ← default
  ○ Pin to 10.2.0
  ○ Add range prefix (^10.2.0)
```

After all selections, the version strings are patched in-place in the source files. A suggested commit message is printed:

```
deps: bump typescript, vitest, lint-staged
```

At the end of every `policy update` run, the CLI writes a **snapshot** — a JSON copy of the full policy (including `toolchain`) to the local XDG config file. Genx reads that file first when present, so local policy changes are picked up without publishing. This runs even when nothing is outdated or no packages were selected (e.g. after manual edits to policy sources).

After running `policy:update`:

1. Run `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck` to verify the patched versions compile cleanly.
2. Commit with the suggested message.
3. Release the package (see below).
4. Update genx: `pnpm update @finografic/deps-policy`.

### `policy:update:release`

One-shot maintainer flow: non-interactive update (`--yes`), then `pnpm build`, commit (`deps: update deps-policy versions`), and `release:github:patch`. Does not publish to GitHub Packages — run `pnpm release:publish` after if needed.

---

### `policy:audit`

Sends all policy deps to the [OSV database](https://osv.dev) (`api.osv.dev/v1/querybatch`) and reports known vulnerabilities. `@finografic/*` packages are skipped (no public OSV data).

Results are grouped by severity: **critical → high → moderate → low**. A clean run prints:

```
  ✓ No known vulnerabilities in 18 packages.
```

> OSV audits concrete version numbers. The range prefix is stripped before querying (e.g. `^5.9.3` → `5.9.3`). This means the audit checks the floor of your declared range — if a vuln exists only in a version above the floor but within the range, it may not be flagged. Run `policy:update` first to ensure policy versions are current.

---

## Release workflow

### Pre-release check

`release:check` runs lint (with auto-fix) and typecheck. This is called automatically by the release scripts.

```bash
pnpm release:check
```

### Bump and publish

```bash
pnpm release:github:patch   # x.y.Z — backwards-compatible fix or dep bump
pnpm release:github:minor   # x.Y.0 — new policy group or new package type
pnpm release:github:major   # X.0.0 — breaking change to exported API
```

Each script:

1. Runs `release:check`
2. Bumps `version` in `package.json` via `pnpm version`
3. Pushes the commit and version tag to GitHub (`git push --follow-tags`)

The package must then be published manually:

```bash
pnpm release:publish
```

This publishes to GitHub Packages (`https://npm.pkg.github.com`).

### When to use each bump

| Change                                              | Bump  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Version string update(s) — no API change            | patch |
| New policy group, new `PackageType`, new CLI export | minor |
| Renamed/removed export, type signature change       | major |

### After release

Verify the new version is visible:

```bash
pnpm view:registry:github
```

Then update `@finografic/genx`:

```bash
# in genx repo
pnpm update @finografic/deps-policy
# commit: deps: update deps-policy to <version>
```

---

## GitHub Packages auth

### Local development

Authentication is handled by `.npmrc` (repo-level and/or global):

```ini
@finografic:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<your GitHub PAT>
```

The token needs `read:packages` scope to install, `write:packages` scope to publish.

For the policy updater, the same token is loaded from `.env`:

```bash
NPM_TOKEN=<your GitHub PAT>
```

The `.env` file is gitignored. See `.env.example` for the key name.

### Creating a GitHub PAT

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens (or classic).
2. Classic token: select `read:packages` and `write:packages`.
3. Copy the token into `~/.npmrc` (for install/publish) and `.env` (for the updater).
